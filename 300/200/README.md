## 100 - Onboarding

You can begin without any upfront investments or special skills. With a Pre-fab gallery, you can start creating immediately without any upfront design work and get quick results.

Our online art exhibitions are fast and easy to set up and update, as many times as you want. You don't need long and costly custom productions or project management to create a fantastic art exhibition online.

The online exhibitions work similarly to regular websites – they are completely hosted on our platform. You don't need to have a separate website. You can share links to your exhibition on any online channel or service you currently use – social media, email, messaging apps or your website.

You can also embed the art exhibition on your website with an iFrame, or add a QR code leading to your online art exhibition to your poster or flyer

## 300 - Home Screen

The home screen has all kinds of widgets and useful links, such as links to gallery floor plans and guides.

There is also a widget that shows the current statistics of your exhibition in one glance.

## 400 - Wizard & Creator

Virtual Art Gallery has two modes for creating an art exhibition – Wizard and Creator.

Get to know the exhibition creation workflow with Wizard. Wizard guides you through the steps of creating online art exhibitions. Wizard is optimal for creating quick drafts and demos on your mobile device.

After drafting your exhibition on the Wizard, you can continue to edit your exhibition further in the full-featured Creator, optimised for desktop usage.

You have the complete gallery selection and more settings options in the Creator. Add interactions and effects to make your exhibition look and feel like you. Include additional details and publish your exhibition on the Discover page.

## 500 - Selecting a Gallery

You can preview the gallery spaces before building your exhibition on them. Preview from the Preview button, and select the gallery template to start creating.

## 600 - Exhibition Settings

You should adjust your settings first. Give your gallery a name, a unique web address, and select the room your exhibition will start from.

## 700 - Uploading Art

Uploading art is as easy as it gets. Go to the Artworks tab in the Creator, select the room you want to upload your artwork to and click the plus icon. Then, select the files you want to display in your exhibition. That's it. You can rearrange the artwork with drag'n'drop.

To adjust and create interactions for your artwork, click it, and an editing window opens.

You can upload images, videos and 3D artwork.

## 800 - Changing an Art Piece

You can replace the art pieces from the Artworks tab. By clicking the piece you want to edit, an edit window opens. You can replace the image either by drag-and-dropping a new item to the window or from the Edit icon on the upper right corner of the image.

## 900 - Frame

You can create simple frames for your artwork directly in the Creator. "Depth" adds frame depth, "Bezel" adds bezel around the artwork, and "Colour" opens a colour pick window, where you can change the colour of the frame.

Need a fancy custom frame? Create it in 3D and upload your model as a separate item!

## 1000 - Size

You can change the size of your artwork in the Edit artwork pop-up window, which opens by clicking the item you want to edit. You can insert the artwork's height or width, and the ratio remains.

## 1100 - Position

The artwork's position inside the gallery is defined by slots in the gallery models. Shifting the artwork from its original position is possible by changing the X, Y and Z axis offset.

Move your artwork left or right (X), up or down (Y), and forward or backward (Z). Use negative values for left, down, and backwards.

## 1200 - Rotation

You can change the artwork's rotation in the same manner as its position: changing the X, Y, and Z axis values.

The X value rotates the artwork upward and downward on the horizontal axis. Positive values rotate artwork downward. Adding a negative value ( - ) in front of the offset value rotates the artwork upward.

The Y value rotates the artwork sideways on the vertical axis. Positive values make artwork face right. Adding a negative value ( - ) in front of the offset value makes the artwork face left.

The Z value rotates the artwork clockwise and counterclockwise. Positive values rotate artwork counterclockwise. Adding a negative value ( - ) in front of the offset value rotates the artwork clockwise.

## 1300 - Artwork Description

Add info texts and a zoomable version of your art. First, make the item "Clickable" and activate the "Info pop-up". Then, you can edit the artwork's description and upload an additional image.

You can also create a transparent image of your text to hang on your wall, just like any art.

## 1400 - External Links

We recommend adding clear instructions for art inquiries or how to contact you. You can redirect to your website, email, phone, or any online store you might use. You can easily add a visual button with a text and link.

Use Markdown language to add a link to the artwork's description or exhibition's description. Markdown syntax for a hyperlink is square brackets followed by parentheses. The square brackets hold the text, and the parentheses hold the link.

For example, [Link Text Here](https://link-url-here.org).

With Markdown, you can get creative with the text formatting while at it!

## 1500 - Additional Content

Including content in your exhibition besides the artworks themselves is essential. You need to give your exhibition a name, a description, and a preview image for optimal sharing experience.

The exhibition name is a short text that describes what the page is about. that will show, for example, on social media shares. The recommended limit is 200 characters.

The preview image shows on your shares - for example, on your social media posts. The optimal size for a preview image is 1920 x 1080 pixels, with a minimum of 200 x 200 pixels. Keep the relevant content in the safe area, an imaginary middle square of the image. Social media platforms will crop the preview image in different ways. You should check the latest recommendations and adjust accordingly.

Here are useful shortcuts to check and preview your sharing settings:

You can also include a welcome image, message, and background audio to polish the art exhibition.

Make a more impactful intro to your exhibtition by adding a background visual!

## 1600 - Saving the Changes

The Virtual Art Gallery Creator automatically saves all your changes. There's only one exception – you only need to click Save when you create the visiting link to your exhibition.

## 1700 - Publishing & Sharing

Before publishing, give your exhibition a unique link name. This is the web address where your visitors will go to see your work.

You can also determine whether or not your exhibition will be published on the Virtual Art Gallery Discover page.

Invite the whole world to experience your art! Share the link to your exhibition freely on your social media, via email, as a QR code or anywhere else you wish. You can also embed your exhibition on your website.
